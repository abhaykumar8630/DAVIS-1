Infinity Castle Arc Summary

After the Swordsmith Village and Hashira Training arcs, the Demon Slayer Corps are at their strongest. Their breathing techniques, coordination, and resolve have reached new heights — and just as they’re ready, Muzan Kibutsuji, the Demon King, launches his final assault. But before the Corps can strike first, everything changes.
One night, as the Hashira and demon slayers gather at the Ubuyashiki estate, Muzan himself appears, intending to kill Kagaya Ubuyashiki, the terminally ill leader of the Demon Slayers. However, Ubuyashiki sacrifices himself and his entire family in a massive explosion to cripple Muzan and trap him in place. The plan works partially — Muzan is injured but enraged. As the surviving slayers rush in, Nakime, the biwa-playing demon who manipulates dimensions, opens the doors of the Infinity Castle beneath Muzan’s command.
In an instant, every slayer, Hashira, and even Muzan himself are pulled into the sprawling, endless maze of floating rooms — the Infinity Castle. The battlefield shifts from the outside world into a warped dimension filled with corridors, moving floors, and an eerie, shifting sky.
Inside, the Hashira are separated and forced into deadly one-on-one battles with the strongest Upper Moons.
Shinobu Kocho, the Insect Hashira, faces Doma (Upper Moon Two) — the very demon who killed her sister. Despite her fatal wounds, she sacrifices herself by poisoning Doma with a massive amount of wisteria toxin, allowing Kanao Tsuyuri and Inosuke Hashibira to finish him off.
Sanemi Shinazugawa (Wind Hashira) and Gyomei Himejima (Stone Hashira) take on Kokushibo (Upper Moon One), who is revealed to be Michikatsu Tsugikuni, the twin brother of the first Breath of the Sun user, Yoriichi Tsugikuni. It’s one of the most intense and emotional fights of the series — combining immense swordsmanship, centuries of rivalry, and the ultimate test of human endurance. With help from Muichiro Tokito (Mist Hashira) and Genya Shinazugawa, they finally bring Kokushibo down, but at the cost of several lives.
Meanwhile, Tanjiro and Giyu Tomioka (Water Hashira) battle Akaza (Upper Moon Three), whose fierce martial prowess pushes them to the limit. Akaza ultimately recalls his human memories and lets himself be destroyed, finally finding peace.
As the castle collapses and Muzan grows impatient, he devours Nakime to control the dimension himself — but Tamayo, the demon doctor allied with the slayers, injects him with a drug that weakens and ages him rapidly.
The Infinity Castle disintegrates, throwing everyone back to the surface. There, the Final Battle Arc (Sunrise Countdown) begins — the climactic confrontation against Muzan under the fading moonlight.
